# GitHub Profile Viewer

GitHub Profile Viewer is a web application that allows users to search for a GitHub user's profile by entering their username. This project is fully responsive and has been developed using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. The application uses the GitHub API to retrieve the user's profile details, including their photo, username, bio, and repository, following, and follower counts. Users can also view the profiles of the user's followers by clicking on the "followers" button.

If the user is not found, the background of the application turns yellow to indicate an error. If the search is successful, the background turns green to indicate a successful search.
